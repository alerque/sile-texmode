# TeX mode for SILE

What it says on the tin.

## Dependencies
* SILE >= v0.10.5.r107-g36868e2, *not* compatible with v0.10.5 or lower (so, all current releases as of 2020-07-15, only works on developer builds), as we need PR&numero;[940](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/pull/940).
* (To build `evil?.sil`) [sile-strike](https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/sile-strike)

## Features
1. All common TeX ligatures (go to function texmode and grep for `:gsub` for a list; feel free to open issues/PRs if any you like are missing)
1. TeX diacritic helpers (We support all on the list in Scott Pakin's [Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List](https://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf), 25 June 2020 edition.)
1. A comprehensive list of math symbols [via Cumhur Korkut](http://github.com/joom/latex-unicoder.vim) (see file `packages/texmode/unicoder.lua`), and the most important text ones (`grep` the aforementioned file for `Fred's`). (As &numero;1, feel free to open issues for more, preferably hundreds of symbols in Lua table format all ready to go please! 😉)
1. A `\notex` command, which ignores what's inside it!
1. `nosymbols=y` or `nocombine=y` to disable what TeX stuff you don't like. (Come on, what did TeX ever do to you! Embrace the suck!)

## Usage

Just as jQuery conditioned JavaScript developers of a certain generation to write a Hello, World! as...

```
$(document).ready(function(){
    alert("おっす、世界！元気のか！俺、ハイ！さって〜じゃね‼‼");
});
```

So too do I aim to condition you.

Here's our Hello, World!

```
\begin{document}\script[src=packages/texmode]\texmode[_="% ]
Hello, world!
"]\end{document}
```

It is recommended to put it all on one line so error lineno's continue to function. The comment, `% ]`, fixes vim. At least, until @alerque fixes his script, then it might not be necessary anymore. But we probably won't want his fixed script, since it'll probably interpret documents like ours as containing a long string, since that's what they are in the grammar. So remember this number: [`09cecddad7`](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/vim-sile/commit/09cecddad7f84d7659aa94481344d13ba2a54bb5), it's the revision of `vim-sile` this works on.

Everything should go inside the bottom and top line. If necessary, you can though call `\texmode` more than once.

## Known issues
Due to the way PR&numero;940 was fixed, (I didn't get to comment until it was merged, I was hoping they'd add Python-esque `"""` super-quotes, or even better, Rust style raw string literals in the form of `r#"sup"#`, where, if for some absurd reason you need to write `"#`, you just make it `r##"sup"#"##`. _Ad infinitum, et ultra!!_) the TeX `"` can't be used as is. You need to escape it.

```
\begin{document}\script[src=packages/texmode]\texmode[_="% ]
\script[src=packages/font-fallback]
\font:add-fallback[font=Noto Sans CJK JP]
% This is exactly how Japanese people talk. Anime and nichanneru, extremely reliable sources, taught me that.
おっす、世界！元気のか！俺ハイハイ！さって〜行くぞ！じゃね‼‼

The above is known as a ``quote". % won't work!
The above is known as a ``quote\". % will work!
"]\end{document}
```

Anyway, you know that even in TeX ``` ``this" ``` is bad, right? It's unbalanced in monospace, silly! Do it ``` ``this way'' ```.
